
# Importance Sampling in CycleGAN setting

We provide PyTorch implementations for both unpaired and paired image-to-image translation. 

The code was written by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://github.com/junyanz) and [Taesung Park](https://github.com/taesung), and supported by [Tongzhou Wang](https://ssnl.github.io/).

To train the cycleGAN:
`python train.py --train_GAN`

To train the weight network:
`python train.py --train_W`
